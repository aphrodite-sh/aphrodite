The ultimate goal of `Aphrodite` is to make [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) and [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) software easier to develop. The `Aphrodite` project has made significant progress to that end but the more progress we make, the more opportunities we see.

A nice feature of these problems thus far is that they can be solved in sequence. Each solution building on the solution before it, each solution making local-first and p2p software a step function easier to develop, and each solution unlocking entirely new capabilities for application developers.

The best way to understand the value of `Aphrodite`, as well as the long term direction of the project, is to understand each of the opportunities that have been identified & the progress made against each.

Opportunities (workstreams):
1. Plurality of client side languages & platforms
2. Lack of declarative conflict resolution in ORMs & DBs
3. Peer-2-Peer discovery & state replication
4. Permissions in a decentralized world
5. From Schemas to Protocols

## Plurality of client side languages & platforms

Cross platform ORM. Starting with the browser.

## Lack of declarative conflict resolution
