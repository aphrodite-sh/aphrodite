The ultimate goal of Aphrodite is to make local first and peer to peer software easier to develop. The Aphrodite project has  made significant progress to that end but the more progress we make the more opportunities we see. Luckily, these opportunities & problems can be solved in sequence. Each solution building on the solution before it, each solution making local first and p2p software a step function easier to develop, and each solution unlocking entirely new capabilities for application developers.

The best way to understand the value of Aphrodite, as well as the long term direction of the project, is to understand each of the problems & opportunities that have been identified so far, the progress made against each, and their overall priorities.

Problems & opportunities:
1. Lack of ORMs on the client
2. Plurality of client side languages & platforms
3. State syncrhonziation between clients
4. From Schemas to Protocols
5. Peer 2 Peer discovery & state replication
6. Permissions in a decentralized world

## Lack of Client Side ORMs

## Plurality of Client Platforms
