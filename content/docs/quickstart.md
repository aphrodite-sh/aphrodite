TODO -- MVP is slated for release on June 17 2022.


`Aphrodite` is under active development here: [https://github.com/tantaman/aphrodite](https://github.com/tantaman/aphrodite)

It **is not** ready for release.

A TodoMVC example app that uses Aphrodite is under development here: [https://github.com/tantaman/aphrodite/tree/main/examples/todo-mvc](https://github.com/tantaman/aphrodite/tree/main/examples/todo-mvc)


Integration tests to show the various described use cases are being built out here: [https://github.com/tantaman/aphrodite/blob/main/packages/integration-tests-ts/src/__tests__/](https://github.com/tantaman/aphrodite/blob/main/packages/integration-tests-ts/src/__tests__/) (and up a dir)
