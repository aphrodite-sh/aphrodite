# TODO:
- Watch mode for codegen
- Simple context setup
- Mutations generated file -- auto gen id, manual import section, ignore from formatting...
  - Merge mode... Preserve manual sections even on formatting changes?
  - Maybe we can ignore format changes? Maybe we can resolve imports?
- Mutator api
  - creates within creates
- Pending write should return the models after await?
  - How do we roll back optimistic writes on failure?
    - Should the fwrk do this?
      - Nuke from cache on create?
- Cache configuration?
  - E.g., always treat objects as "shared" or not?
    - Not write-through? Other things?
